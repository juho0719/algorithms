/**
 * Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, 
 * return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait 
 * after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. 
 * If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
 * Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
 * Output: [1,1,1,0]
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
 * Output: [1,1,0]
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= temperatures.length <= 10^5
 * 30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100
